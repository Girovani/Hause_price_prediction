# Hause_price_prediction
 That's a undergoing project, it will be updated by the time
 I will be trying to use pipelines in this project and another ways to open the files, i'm very excited with this project, 
 bacause I will start searching for alternative solutions and optimizing the modeling, despise what i said this project also
 isn't the best solution for the problemens, like the others is a way to me learn new thing.
 
 I got tried a lot of preprocessing and transformation functions, some of them don't worked very well and have been removed.
 the same way of these I also tried out a bit of machine learning models, I hope you enjoy it.
 
 Recently my time came to be a little bit scarce and thanks to it the update of this notebook has slowed a bit.
